# folk-post
## what is this?
Folk Post is an application that's meant to facilitate folk posting[1] by providing a filterable database of items, where they are, and where they need to be.

## how do I use it?
If you have an item that you figure somebody left at your home, click the "found something?" link at the top of the index page. If you lost an item, click the "lost something?" one. Follow instructions as given from there, and it will show up in the list - with any luck, somebody else will see it, and take appropriate actions!  
If you see an item in the list that belongs to you, you can click on the item's name to open its page, and then use the "claim item" link to mark it as belonging to you, and accordingly needing to get to you.  
If there is an item that's currently with you, click on the item's name, then the link that says "is this item with you?"

## can I contribute?
Sure! It's on github, after all.

## what features do you have planned for the future?
### short-term
support for changing a user's information

### medium-term
make it pretty
add event field
	with autocomplete, ideally, to allow for effective searching
images of items (use GridFS, probably)
make user page

### long-term (if ever)
proper locations
	like, from openstreetmap or s/t
email notifications 
	when somebody claims an item you posted 
	when an item you claimed moves

[1]transporting items (or people) through people traveling, rather than a normal postal service
